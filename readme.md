# Rice Grain Classifier (Flask App)

This is a simple web application built with **Flask** and **OpenCV** to classify rice grains in an uploaded image as **Broken** or **Whole**.  

It uses contour detection and shape analysis (area, length, aspect ratio) to determine if each grain is broken, and overlays a count summary on the result.
